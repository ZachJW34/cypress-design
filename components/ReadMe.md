# @cypress-design/components

Each component will contain a vue and a react directory.
As much as possible, we strive to keep them with the same props and methods.
Since the API differs from Vue to React, we mostly want an equivalence in behavior.

When a decision must be made between having the same API or the same appearance, we will always **favor appearance** and User Experience.
